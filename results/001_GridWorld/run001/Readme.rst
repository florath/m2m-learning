This was done using the source code:
https://github.com/awjuliani/DeepRL-Agents/blob/master/Double-Dueling-DQN.ipynb

with one adaption:
Instead of an endless game - as in the original - a game is ended when
the first time a fire was reached.

In this case a reward of 0 was provided.

The result file contains all the results from 10000 episodes.
